GUI and CLI have a very simple difference on the surface. GUI has a visual oriented ui. Consisting of visual aids like pictures, logos, icons, and elements, CLI uses text as its medium. From what it sounds like GUI is more accessible to people unfamiliar with coding, whereas CLI can get to  the nitty gritty for those who might be a little more savvy to coding. GUI sounds optimal to a novice but is actually slower for experts in the field. CLI consume less memory than GUI. This would be something to consider on a project that requires specific demands in regards to the computers memory. I think both systems have their place for sure but the real question is which system benefits the project you may be working on. Rather than what one works for me. Having the right tools in hand can be crucial.
